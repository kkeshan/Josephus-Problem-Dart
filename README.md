# Josephus Problem solved using Dart and a graph

This repo contains two files "brute-force.dart" and "formula.dart". "brute-force.dart" uses a brute force approach to solving the Josephus problem. It will run through the entire killing spree for a given n, and print out the solution for you.

The other file, "formula.dart", uses a formula determined from "brute-force.dart" to simply output the answer much more quickly and efficiently compared to "brute-force.dart".

I've created this repo to go along with my blog post https://techranc.blogspot.com/2018/06/josephus-problem-solved-using-dart-and.html

Please feel free to use this wherever you like.
